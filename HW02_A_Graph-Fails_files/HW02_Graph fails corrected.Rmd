### Graph Fail 1

What error is being thrown? How do you correct it? (hint, the error message tells you)

```{r}
data(mpg) #this is a dataset from the ggplot2 package

mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = "blue")) %>% + #change "city" to "cty"
  geom_point()

```

### Graph Fail 2
Why aren't the points blue? It is making me blue that the points in the graph aren't blue :`(
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + #move aes to ggplot, specify color in geom.
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```
