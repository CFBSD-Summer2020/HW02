# HW02
Due 7/13/2020

There are two parts to the HW this week. 

[The first assignment asks you to fix some common issues with making ggplot plots ](HW02_A_Graph-Fails.Rmd). You can find the code in that link or the file: HW02_A_Graph-Fails.Rmd

#I have attempted to fix the code in HW02_A_Graph_Fails.Rmd

The second part of the HW will likely be more challenging as it asks you to try to recreate the graphs from just the images. [Here is a link to the markdown file](HW02_B_Mimic.md) with the images you will try to recreate or you can just find the file "HW02_B_Mimic.md" or find the html version "HW02_B_Mimic.html" (which would need to be previewed in RStudio or opened up by an internet browser to view properlY) in the repo. To make your lives easier, I also created a "starter" document that has the same code that you can find in the markdown (but obviously the code for the graphs themselves was removed). [Here is a link to the starter document](HW02_B_Mimic_starter.Rmd) or you can look for the file "HW02_B_Mimic_starter.Rmd" 

#I have written code for the graphs in HW02_B_Mimic.md
#My PNG files should be included in this directory for the graphs.

#Thanks for stopping by!
